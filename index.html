          <p>I'm Muhammad, a Full Stack Engineer who rapidly ships MVPs and SaaS products by leveraging highly
            capable AI agents to get the job done fast and securely!</p>

          <h3>Why work with me?</h3>
          <p>I'm not just a "vibe" coder but a "problem solver" and an "engineer". I write real code, debug AI-generated
            messes, and build products that can actually be shipped.</p>

          <h3>I can help you if you:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Got stuck using Lovable, Bolt, or Cursor - I'll debug and get you back on track</li>
            <li>Built your UI with an agent, but need backend integration (e.g., Supabase, Firebase)</li>
            <li>Have a working MVP but need clean, production-ready code</li>
            <li>Want to build your product from scratch with solid engineering</li>
          </ul>

          <p>With 3+ years of experience building end-to-end solutions, I've helped startups and mid-sized companies
            bring ideas to life - fast, clean, and with clarity.</p>

          <h3>AI Tooling & LLM Integration</h3>
          <p>I specialize in working with modern AI tools and LLM-based systems to supercharge your applications with
            intelligent capabilities. Whether you're building an AI-powered SaaS or need help integrating generative AI
            into your existing product, I've got you covered</p>

          <h4>Hands-on experience with AI platforms and tools:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Lovable.ai (debugging, extending, and preparing for production)</li>
            <li>Bolt.new (debugging, extending, and preparing for production)</li>
            <li>Cursor for blazingly fast development</li>
            <li>GitHub Copilot & Copilot Chat for productivity and pair programming</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>LLM API integrations:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>OpenAI (GPT-4, Assistants API, DALLÂ·E)</li>
            <li>Google Gemini</li>
            <li>Anthropic Claude</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Whether you're building from scratch or want to enhance your AI product's performance and reliability, I
            can help you debug, optimize, and launch with confidence.</p>

          <h3>Next.js & Supabase Expertise</h3>
          <p>Beyond AI tooling, I bring deep technical expertise in building production-grade applications with Next.js
            v15 and Supabase. I have shipped several products with this very tech stack!</p>

          <p>With Next.js v15, I follow best practices to craft fast, SEO-optimized, and scalable applications using:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for personalized content and performance.</li>
            <li>Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) to blend static and dynamic content efficiently.</li>
            <li>App Router architecture, server actions, and advanced middleware to streamline UX and routing logic.
            </li>
            <li>SEO optimization using meta tag strategies, dynamic OG image generation, and performance insights from
              Core Web Vitals.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>On the backend, I leverage Supabase as a powerful and flexible alternative to Firebase, backed by
            PostgreSQL:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Deep knowledge and hands on experience with Row Level Security (RLS) to secure multi-tenant apps.</li>
            <li>Efficient use of storage buckets for user uploads and asset handling.</li>
            <li>Implementation of edge functions for fast, geo-distributed logic.</li>
            <li>Creating stored procedures and Postgres functions for business logic.</li>
            <li>Real-time features with Supabase Realtime Brodcast & Channels for live collaboration, notifications, or
              dynamic UIs.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This combination allows me to build fast, reactive, secure full-stack apps with strong performance and
            reliability from day one.</p>

          <p>What sets me apart from others is effective development and ensuring that it works in the "production"
            phase. I make sure the applications I make are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Scalable: They perform well under heavy load.</li>
            <li>Reliable: They work effectively even when things go wrong, tolerating 90% of faults.</li>
            <li>Maintainable: They are easy to operate and update.</li>
          </ul>
